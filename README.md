# MultiClass-Softmax-Logistic-Regression 

This repository implements a multi-class classifier using Softmax Regression, built upon binary logistic regression. Each class is modeled with its own binary logistic regression classifier, and the probabilities are combined using the Softmax function to predict the most likely class for a given input sample. 

## Overview 

The implementation includes: 

- **Probability computation**: A method to compute the probability of a sample (or samples) belonging to each class.
- **Modular design**: Reusable code for training and testing multi-class classification tasks.
- **Practical example**: Demonstration of logistic regression for multi-class problems.

This project extends the concepts of binary logistic regression (as implemented in `reglog.py`) to handle multiple classes effectively. It serves as a foundational resource for understanding and implementing multi-class classification using logistic regression.
